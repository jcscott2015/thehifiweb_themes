# thehifiweb_themes
Drupal 6 themes developed for Canadian based ecommerce site. The themes are based on the Zen theme project.

The site uses domain modules to swap themes based on URL. Canadian customers would see the Canadian themed site, complete with Canadian dollar prices, Canadian tax calculations, and Canadian postal options. U. S. customers would see the usahifi theme with local currency, tax, and postal options. The ecommerce backend (Ubercart) and inventory was shared and administered by all sites.

I maintained this site up to 2010.
